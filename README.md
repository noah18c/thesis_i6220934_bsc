Thesis Title: Time Series Prediction Models Using Tensor Decomposition
Description
This repository contains all the materials related to my thesis on "Time Series Prediction Models Using Tensor Decomposition," which explores the efficacy and interpretability of tensor decomposition techniques in time series prediction models. The core objective is to compare tensor-based models with traditional matrix-based models in handling complex datasets like financial markets.

Objectives
To define and implement a tensor decomposition-based model for time series prediction.
To conduct a comparative analysis of tensor-based and matrix-based models.
To evaluate the performance of these models on real-world financial market data.
Repository Structure
bash
Copy code
/thesis-document        - Contains the thesis document in LaTeX format.
/code                   - Contains MATLAB scripts and live scripts (MLX files) used for analysis and modeling.
/datasets               - Contains sample datasets used for model training and testing.
/results                - Contains output results, including figures and tables, generated by the scripts.
Installation
Instructions to set up the environment to run the scripts:

bash
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/noah18c/thesis_i6220934_bsc.git
cd thesis_i6220934_bsc

# No specific installation required for MATLAB scripts, just ensure you have a compatible MATLAB version installed.
Usage
Details on how to run the scripts and reproduce the results:

bash
Copy code
# Navigate to the code directory
cd code

# Run the MATLAB scripts
matlab -batch "run_script_name"
Replace run_script_name with the actual name of the MATLAB script you wish to run.

Dependencies
MATLAB (R202X or later)
Required MATLAB toolboxes:
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
Signal Processing Toolbox
Results
Brief description of what each script outputs and where the results can be found.
