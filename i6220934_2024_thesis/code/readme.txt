This readme is meant to clarify how to use this code.

There are three live scripts:

1. i6220934_thesis_AR_exp: shows how the experiments can be run
2. i6220934_thesis_results: shows the results of the experiments run in the first live script
3. i6220934_thesis_signaltests: simulates the effects of different parameter values on the randomly generated signals

To replicate the results, simply use the open function in matlab and open the file "i6220934_thesis_results_t100.mat". 
Once this has been imported into matlab all the results can be replicated described the second live script.

The files starting with ar_ex... are the experiment functions used to collectively experiment different things
The other ar_... files are the actual models.
